## Summary
This box focuses on exploiting a Windows machine hosting an IIS service as well as an ftp service which gives write access to the IIS directory. Metasploit can then be used to gain a foothold and also root the box. 

## Foothold & privilege escalation
Let's start out by doing a port scan with nmap:
```console
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-12 11:52 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.129.237.156
Host is up (0.027s latency).

```
Anonymous ftp login is allowed. Lets try that.
```console

Based on the contents of the directory, we have access to the IIS7 directory. This means that if we put a .aspx{: .filepath} file in the directory we would be able to access it via our browser. In that case let's create a reverse shell via msfvenom:

```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/Devel]

Notice that we uploaded the file via the `PUT` command.

We can then use the handler provided by metasploit:
```
