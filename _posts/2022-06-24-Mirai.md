## Summary
This box is quite interesting, in the sense that once you have rooted the box, you are actually not quite done. You first need to recover the flag, which was accidentally deleted. A very interesting concept and a unique way to add a forensics challenge to the box.

## Foothold
We start out by doing a nmap port scan
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/mirai]

Three ports are open on the machine, port 22, 80 and 53 which is hosting a Domain Name Service. If we try to visit the web application, we just get greeted with a blank page. Scanning the application with gobuster reveals the following:

If we visit `/admin` we are lead to the pi-hole admin console.

![pi-hole admin console](pi-hole_admin.png)
_The pi-hole admin console_

We can then attempt to login.

![admin login](login.png)

If we attempt the default credentials `pi:raspberry` on the admin console we fail to login, however we can actually ssh into the machine with these credentials. 

![ssh](ssh.png) 

## Privilege escalation
Running sudo -l reveals that we have complete access to sudo, so becoming root is as simple as running `sudo su -` or simply `su -`
```console
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for pi on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User pi may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ su -
Password: 

SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed.
This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password.

root@raspberrypi:~# 
```
Rooted! Or not? Reading `root.txt`{: .filepath} reveals that the flag has been moved: 
```console
root@raspberrypi:~# cat root.txt
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```
Using `df` we can see filesystems as well as where they are mounted on the system.
```console

```
If we go to `/media/usbstick` we find this message from James:
```console
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# ls
damnit.txt  lost+found
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# cat damnit.txt 
Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

-James
```
We can use `dcfldd` on the target machine to make a copy of the filesystem, which we can then coy to our system via `scp`.
```console
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# dcfldd if=/dev/sdb of=/home/pi/usb2
256 blocks (8Mb) written.
320+0 records in
320+0 records out
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# 
``` 
We can then run testdisk on it.

![testdisk](testdisk.png)

We then select the disk we want to test, the partition table type and list partition. I simply selected None as partition type. We can then see the contents of the partition.

![partition](partition.png) 

Testdisk finds root.txt on the partition, however if we copy the file with testdisk we get an empty file out. However since the file is clearly present somewhere on the filesystem, we can run strings on it and hopefully recover some of the data. 
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/mirai]

```
Luckily the output of `strings` gives us the root flag, and we have finally rooted the machine!
