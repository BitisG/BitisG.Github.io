## Summary
This was an easy box that focused on enumerating a wordpress site, getting access as admin and then installing a malicious php plugin that gave a reverse shell. Once in on the box, a password for another user could be found which had sudo rights to run `initctl`. This could be exploited by changing the config file into running arbitrary commands.
## Foothold
We start out by checking out the site:

If we go to the issue tracker we are greeted with a wordpress website.

We can also go into the testing directory, which has directory listing enabled.

If we view the source code for the `wp-config.php.save` file, we get some credentials.

We can then login with the credentials `administrator:devteam01`

As the administrator of the wordpress site we can upload a zip file which contains a malicious plugin. I just used a standard php-reverse shell, zipped it and then uploaded it on to the wordpress site. 

That sead it is important that the plugin contains the headers 
```console
/*
Plugin Name: WordPress Maintanance Plugin
Plugin URI: wordpress.org
Description: WordPress Maintenance Activities
Author: WordPress
Version: 1.0
Author URI: wordpress.org
*/
```
At the top of the script otherwise it will not unzip and install the plugin. The actual content of the header can of course be changed as long as the fields are kept the same. We can then go to the plugin menu and activate our plugin, getting a reverse shell.

```

## Pivot
As the nginx user, we find an interesting file labelled `/etc/autologin/passwd` with the contents of `SummerHereWeCome!!`. We try this password on the users on the machine, until we successfully login as katie.

## Privilege escalation
Katie has sudo rights to `/sbin/initctl`. We can edit the config file found under `/etc/init/test.conf` so that arbitrary commands are being run as root. 
```console
katie@spectra /etc/init $ cat test.conf 
description "Test node.js server"
author      "katie"

start on tmp
task
exec cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/output
katie@spectra /etc/init $ sudo /sbin/initctl emit tmp
katie@spectra /etc/init $ cat /tmp/output
