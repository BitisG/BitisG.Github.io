## Description
This app has stored my credentials and I can only login automatically. I tried to intercept the login request and restore my password, but this seems to be a secure connection. Can you help bypass this security restriction and intercept the password in plaintext?

## Setup and flag
I used genymotion to emulate an android device.

Install necessary tools with the commands
```console
pip install Frida
pip install objection
pip install frida-tools
```
Connect to the emulater via `adb`, this can be done with the commands `adb devices` and `adb connect IP:PORT`
check architechture with the command: 
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/challenges/android/pinned]
└─$ adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
x86
```
Download the corresponding frida server from [this link](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/), and then push it to the device with the following command:
```console
adb push frida-server-15.1.28-android-x86 /data/local/tmp
```
and then give permissions to the server with the command 
```console
adb shell chmod 777 /data/local/tmp/frida-server-15.1.28-android-x86
```
Get the burpsuite certificate by visiting `http://burpsuite/` in a browser where the burpsuite proxy is active. The certificate is then pushed to the device with the following command:
```console
adb push cacert.der /data/local/tmp/cert-der.crt
```
The reason for the specific name is that the injection script is looking for a file with that specific name. We also need to ensure that burpsuite is ready to intercept the traffic coming from the android device, and that the android is routing its' traffic through the proxy. This is done by entering wifi options on the emulater, checking manual proxy configuration and then entering the IP of the device hosting the emulater and the port that burpsuite is listening on. I also set it to listen on a specific port as well as all interfaces. 


The script is then pushed to the device and run with the following commands:
```console
adb push C:\ADB\fridascript.js /data/local/tmp
adb shell /data/local/tmp/frida-server &
```
Once the server is running we can list all running processes with `frida-ps -U`.

I then injected the script with the command `frida -U -p 2599 -l fridascript.js --no-paus`

```console

We can then view the traffic in burpsuite:
