## Summary
This was one of the easier boxes on the platform. With comments left in the HTML source code and a SUID binary giving root access immediatly. In any case, you can learn some fuzzing on this box since it is required to find the credentials for the ticket page. 

## Foothold

We start by adding bank.htb to our `/etc/hosts`{: .filepath} file. When visiting the site we get greeted with a login page:

You could try to perform some SQL-injection to bypass the login, but it wont work. Instead we fuzz for directories via gobuster:
```console
gobuster dir -u http://bank.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php

===============================================================
```

Entering the `/balance-transfer`{: .filepath} dir we find a lot of files. All have the same size, except for one which is much smaller:

![content of /balance-transfer sorted by size](smallfile.png)

Contents of the file can be found below:
```txt
--ERR ENCRYPT FAILED

```

Using the credentials to login, we can access a page where we can upload a file. If we view the source code we can see that the developer left a comment saying that any file endning in .htb will be executed as php for debugging purposes.

![Web page source code](source.png)

Uploading a standard php reverse shell and renaming it to something ending in .htb will give a reverse shell when trying to access it after uploading it via the ticket functionality.

![Malicious ticket](ticket.png)

Clicking on the ticket will execute the php code. 
## Privilege escalation
Receiving the reverse shell, we start out by looking at SUID binaries:
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/banking]
└─$ nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.17.182] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.29.200] 44466

$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/var/htb/bin/emergency
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
```

One stands out immediatly, namely the file `/var/htb/bin/emergency`{: .filepath}

Simply running it gives us root access. Rooted!
