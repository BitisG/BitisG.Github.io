## Summary 
This was a very easy box that only required some basic google skills aswell as some knowledge of metasploit. let's take a look.

## Foothold & Privesc
Let's start out by doing an nmap port scan. 
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/Legacy]
└─$ nmap -sC -sV 10.129.227.181

The nmap scan reveals that the machine is running Windows XP as its' OS. Ports 139 and 445 are also open, which are used for SMB. I initially thought the machine would be vulnerable to eternalblue, and indeed it is, but the metasploit module for Eternalblue that I found only had payloads for x64 architecture, which the target machine was not using. Searching for related vulnerabilities points us towards the metasploit module found described [here](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi/). let's try to use it.
```console
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi) > run
