## Summary
This was an interesting box which was centered around a new exploit which was recently disclosed at the time of the release. Enumeration of the server headers was needed to get to a worpress site, which contained a vulnerability that allows us to read unpublished drafts. These drafts contain a link to a chat application, where we can exploit a chatbot into getting access to a file containing crdentials.
## Foothold
Let's start out with an nmap port scan: 
```console
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Sat Feb 12 16:34:12 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -p- -o nmap/full.txt -Pn 10.129.139.201

The system has 3 ports open, 22, 80 and 443. If we access the site hosted on the system we are greeted with a standard centOS welcome page

![](welcome1.png)

If we take a look at the response we receive from the server when trying to access the site, we see a header named `x-backend-server`.

![](burp.png)

It contains the domain of another application that we can also access after we add it to our hosts file. When accessing `office.paper`, we are greeted with a Wordpress site which is made to resemble the website of a famous paper company.

![](welcome2.png)

If we take a look at one of the posts, one user is saying that the drafts feature is insecure. 

![](post.png)

The Wappalyzer plug-in tells us that the version of Wordpress is `5.2.3`. Searching for vulnerabilities in this version gives us [this](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3413b879-785f-4c9f-aa8a-5a4a1d5e0ba2) which allows us to view private and unpiblished drafts. If we go to `http://office.paper/?static=1` we see all the private drafts on the site. The drafts include a registration link for a chat platform: `http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY`. We add the domain to our hosts file and register our user. When we enter the chat room we see that somebody has added a chatbot which supports a lot of features including dm's. 

![](bot.png)

When we chat with the bot we discover that we can access local files on the system

![](lfi.png)

We can use this to access the `.env` file of the chatbot, which contains the password of the `dwight` user. (We can figure this out based on the fact that the bot is running in his home directory)

![](password.png)

We can use the credentials `dwight:Queenofblad3s!23` to login via ssh.

## Privilege escalation
Once we have access as dwight, we run linpeas to see if any interesting is on the system. 

```console
---SNIP---

╔══════════╣ CVEs Check
Vulnerable to CVE-2021-3560   
---SNIP---
```
As we can see linpeas tells us the system is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3560, also known as pwnkit. Exploiting this is trivial, we simply duse one of multiple POC's found on the internet. For example [this](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation) one.

```
