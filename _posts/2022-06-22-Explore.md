## Summary
This was an easy android box centered around enumerating an android system, as well as using knowledge of adb features to root the device.

## Foothold
We start out by doing a port scan with nmap.
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/Explore]
└─$ nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.137.244

```
The system is hosting an sh service on port 2222, as well as a "freeciv" service on port 5555. Port 42833 is hosting an unknown service and port 59777 is hosting a Bukkit service. Further examination and some googling reveals that 5555 is also used by adb on some Android devices. That said, it is filtered and therefore not available to us at the moment, instead if we search for port 59777, it seems like it is actually used by a service named ES File Explorer. It is also mentioned that the service contains a vulnerability.

![Research on port 59777](port59777.png)

I found a POC for the vulnerability [here](https://github.com/fs0c131y/ESFileExplorerOpenPortVuln). Using the POC to have a look at the file system reveals an insteresting file.
```console

```
There is a jpg on the system named creds. Unfortunately, the POC does not allow us to download files from the system. Luckily metasploit has a module for this vulnerability as well, with the functionality to download arbitrary files.

## Privilege escalation
We can now login as Kristi on the Android device. While doing so we will do port forwarding to communicate with port 5555 on the target system.
```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/Explore]

Once the port has been forwarded, we can can connect via adb. Once connected, adb offers commands such as `adb root` and `adb unroot` to root and unroot the user connecting via adb.
